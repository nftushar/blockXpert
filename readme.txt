== External services ==

This plugin connects to OpenAI's API ([https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions](https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions)) to provide AI-powered features for generating FAQ content and product recommendations. When you use the AI blocks, your page content (text, product descriptions) and your OpenAI API key are sent to OpenAI's API to generate relevant content. No data is sent automaticallyâ€”only when you actively use the AI blocks in the editor.

This service is provided by OpenAI. Please review their [terms of use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use) and [privacy policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy).

== Installation ==

1.  Upload the `blockxpert` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3.  Navigate to the 'BlockXpert' admin menu.
4.  Enable the blocks you want to use.
5.  For AI features, enter your OpenAI API key in the block settings in the editor sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an OpenAI API key? =

Yes, for the AI-powered features (AI FAQ and Product Recommend AI), you will need to provide your own OpenAI API key in the block's settings panel in the editor.

= Is WooCommerce required? =

WooCommerce is only required for the blocks that interact with products, such as the Product Slider and Product Recommend AI. Other blocks will work without it.

= Can I customize the look and feel? =

Yes! Most blocks come with built-in styling options, such as light/dark themes and different layouts (grid, list, slider).

= What data is sent to OpenAI? =

When you use the AI features, your page content (text, product descriptions) is sent to OpenAI's API to generate relevant FAQs or product recommendations. Your API key is also sent for authentication. No data is sent automatically - only when you actively use the AI blocks.

= Is my data secure? =

Your data is sent to OpenAI's secure API endpoints. We do not store your API key or the content you send to OpenAI. Please review OpenAI's privacy policy for more information about how they handle your data.
